I would disclose the URL of my site, and the nginx reverse-proxy & TLS encyption configuration, but I am afraid of getting DDoS'ed, as my architecture does not autoscale.

## Getting Data In
I used an instance of Splunk Enterprise on a DigitalOcean VM. I set up a reciever on this machine. I set up the Splunk Universal Forwarder on the web app host, and forwarded all web traffic logs to Splunk to the indexer 'bw_webapp'. I then made the dashboard above with the logs.
